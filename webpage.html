	<p>
		Chris Ambrosino’s life changed when he was gifted a drum kit and a guitar from his grandparents.<br>
	A working drummer while still a teen in upstate NY and a member of the first MTV generation with a <br>
	passion for Brit Pop, early metal, ‘70s NYC and later gritty Honky Tonk laced Americana from the Midwest.<br>
	 By 20, Ambrosino was working the NYC club circuit building chops and becoming a multi-instrumentalist, <br>
	 writer, singer and front line performer. </p>

	 <p>Virginia transplants, Chris Ambrosino (NY) and Jim Gordon (OH) can both point to pivotal events<br>
	 that defined the direction their musical lives would take. For Gordon who comes from a multi-generational<br>
	 musical family, it was when he first heard “Driver Eight” by REM on WMMS in Cleveland Ohio, when all that <br>
	 he knew about country and blues music (Cash, Nelson, Jennings, Owens, Snow, BB King, Wolf, Waters) came into focus.<br>
	  It was Southern, it was smart, it was emotional and all these years later, as he will attest, “runs through<br>
	   the dozens of tunes I’ve written”. </p>

	 <p>Northern Virginia native, Tricia Lani Chapman adds thoughtful and soulful layers to Blue Ribbon's sound <br>
	 via bass guitar and vocals. Her laid back style and vintage tones are a "tip of the hat" to the great <br>
	 bass players of the past. Tricia has been playing bass for over a decade and has played in worship bands as <br>
	 a guitarist, bassist and a drummer, while also occasionally playing piano and clarinet! She plays and contributes <br>
	 vocals to most studio tracks and all of Blue Ribbon's live shows.</p>

	 Although he is the youngest member of Blue Ribbon, Gavin plays drums with the heart of an old soul.  He is<br>
	 currently a student at Norfolk Statue University.  When he isn't spending his friday nights with us,<br>
	 he is marching on the football field with his brothers in green. </p>
